## Hey buddy 👋

<img align="left" width="170" height="170" alt="GIF" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/llarwdtFqG63IlqUR1/source.gif" />

Let me introduce myself :slightly_smiling_face: I am Egemen, as you all coding was my hobby and life style. I met coding at the very beginning of my academic career. Although my department is electronic engineering, I switched to computer engineering department :relieved: And now I have about 6 years of native mobile application development and design experience. I am currently working at DonanımHaber as an Android developer. Besides I am application consultant at Newark USA LLC. I couldn't spare a lot of time for my personal development due to my busy business life, I think it's time to get more active in Github, follow me :metal:
